# CapiumForum
A small, lightweight portable forum written in Node.js


### Welcome
This is a small lightweight "board" based forum. Similar to Reddit in some ways. It was written in my sophomore year of Highschool. It was the first website I ever wrote. 

The forum serves json through websockets which allow real-time chat-like communication. The forum has functionality to like and dislike posts, as well as post pictures. 

Using websockets and json also allows me to serve threads much more quickly. Unlike heavier forums, this one serves pages in milliseconds. 

The entire forum setup is 11KB compressed, miniscule in comparison to other forums, but similar in core functionality. Now that I am a more mature developer, I will likely add more features to the forum, and enhance the security.

### Running the Server

Use the terminal command :

```node server.js ```


### Demo
There is a small demo up and running at
